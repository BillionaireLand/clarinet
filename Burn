Changes:
 * secure-burn-rune-ordinal now takes principal for id:  This maintains consistency and type safety with the burn-rune-ordinal function.
 * Added ownership check in secure-burn-rune-ordinal:  Even though this function is meant for authorized users, it's good practice to include the ownership check for added security.
 * Different event name:  The print statement now emits "secure-burn-rune-ordinal" to distinguish it from the regular burn event.
This updated code incorporates the suggested improvements and ensures consistency in handling ordinal IDs. It also includes an additional layer of security by checking ownership even in the authorized burn function.
